Summary:

In the inner ear, both auditory and vestibular systems, responsible for hearing and balance, utilise sensory hair cells (HCs) for the detection of mechanical signals of sound and head acceleration and movement. In mammals, damage to these HCs can result in permanent deafness and balance issues due to their lack of regenerative potential, which has been identified to decrease during the maturation process of vestibular system. Therefore, we aim to characterise transcriptional programs that might regulate the HC regeneration capability over the developmental process using gene regulatory networks of mouse utricle, built using the SCENIC package, on single-nuclei RNA sequencing data. Gene sets (regulons) identified by SCENIC show clustering over embryonic and adult timepoints during the maturation and significantly diﬀerent activity between and within HC subtypes and clusters. Retinoic X Receptor Alpha (Rxrα) that emerged from this in-silico analysis was validated in vivo using mouse utricles. The expression of Rxrα was seen specific to type 1 HCs (HC1) cells in increasing number of cells over maturation, confirming our in-silico predictions. The results indicate that Rxrα signalling might be crucial for HC1 specification and could potentially be used as a marker of mature HC1. Overall, this study has shed light on several interesting functional mechanisms that might be key to driving the maturation-related HC regeneration and their subtype specification in late postnatal stages.

All raw data has been provided by the Lipovsek lab. The GRN analysis has been carried out with the help of Hamid Lab and the experimental validation was assisted by Lipovsek Lab.
